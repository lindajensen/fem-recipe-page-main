## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm not sure. I think a learned a bit more about a mobile-first workflow. This project was really frustrating for me because I couldn't get the image (in mobile view) right. But I did learn that you can change the color of bullet points by using the pseudo-element ::marker so that was kind of cool.

```css
li::marker {
    color: var(--darkraspberry);
    font-weight: 700;
}
```

### Continued development

I need to keep working on and practicing Flexbox and maybe work a bit more with CSS Grid. And I need to keep practicing and learning more about responsive design and a mobile-first approach. 

### Useful resources

- [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::marker) - This helped me with how I should go about changing the color of the bullet points.
- [nekoCalc](https://nekocalc.com/px-to-rem-converter) - This is an amazing converter when it comes to changing px to rem.
